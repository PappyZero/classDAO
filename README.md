# classDAO
# Overview
ClassDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed for a class or group where each member holds a unique NFT representing their membership. 
The DAO will allow members to submit and vote on proposals. Only members holding the class NFT can participate in the governance process.


A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a digital entity that operates on a blockchain network, enabling decentralized decision-making and autonomous governance. Key characteristics:

1. Decentralized: No central authority or single point of control.
2. Autonomous: Self-governing, with rules encoded in smart contracts.
3. Organization: A collective entity with shared goals and interests.


# Features of classDAO :

1. Blockchain-based: Utilizes distributed ledger technology.
2. Smart contracts: Self-executing contracts with predefined rules.
3. Token-based governance: Members vote using tokens.
4. Transparent: All transactions and decisions are publicly visible.
5. Autonomous decision-making: Smart contracts enforce rules.






# Contract Details
In building this classDAO, several types of contracts were necessary :

1. Governance Contract: Defines decision-making processes, voting mechanisms, and proposal submission rules.

2. Token Contract: Manages token creation, distribution, and ownership.

3. Membership Contract: Specifies membership requirements, roles, and privileges.

4. Proposal Contract: Handles proposal submission, voting, and execution.

5. ERC-721 Token Standard (Ethereum): For non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
